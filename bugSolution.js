The core issue is often dependency conflicts involving AndroidX.  A common approach involves examining `package.json` and looking for potential conflicts or outdated packages.  You might need to update specific packages or use version ranges to resolve incompatibilities.

Here's an example approach to troubleshooting:

1. **Check `package.json`:** Carefully examine your dependencies for outdated packages or known conflicts. Pay special attention to packages related to UI components, networking, or any other third-party libraries.

2. **Update Dependencies:** Use `expo update` and `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to update your project dependencies to their latest versions. This often addresses many issues.

3. **Force AndroidX:** In certain situations, explicitly forcing the use of AndroidX can resolve the jetifier conflicts.  This involves making sure that your dependencies explicitly support AndroidX or are already migrated. 

4. **Clean and Rebuild:** After making any changes to your dependencies or package.json, always perform a clean build:
   ```bash
   expo prebuild --clean
   expo run:android
   ```

5. **Investigate Specific Error Messages:** While the error is often non-specific, there might be clues within the full build output. Carefully examine the error logs for any more detailed information related to specific conflicting dependencies.

6. **(If Necessary) Create a Minimal Reproducible Example:** If none of the above steps work, create a minimal, reproducible example to isolate the problem. This will make it easier to identify the specific conflicting dependency or configuration issue.
