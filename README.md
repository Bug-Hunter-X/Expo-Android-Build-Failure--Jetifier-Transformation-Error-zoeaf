# Expo Android Build Failure: Jetifier Transformation Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Android apps with Expo CLI, related to the `jetifier` transform.  The `jetifier` is responsible for converting libraries that use the older Android support libraries to AndroidX.

## Problem
The build process fails during the `jetifier` transformation step, usually without a very clear error message. This is often caused by dependency conflicts or incorrect configurations related to AndroidX support.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully examining your project dependencies and resolving conflicts. Often, upgrading dependencies or making sure they are compatible with AndroidX will solve the problem.  In some cases, explicitly defining the AndroidX versions in your project can be necessary.  The provided `bugSolution.js` demonstrates one approach to resolving the issue, but the specific solution depends on the individual project dependencies and their configurations.
